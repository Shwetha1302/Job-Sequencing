# Job-Sequencing
It takes the Profits and Deadlines as the input and gives out the order in which the jobs will be sequenced.

Problem Statement:
In job sequencing problem, the objective is to find a sequence of jobs, which is completed within their deadlines and gives maximum profit.
Solution:
Let us consider, a set of n given jobs which are associated with deadlines and profit is earned, if a job is completed by its deadline. These jobs need to be ordered in such a way that there is maximum profit.
It may happen that all of the given jobs may not be completed within their deadlines.
Assume, deadline of ith job Ji is di and the profit received from this job is pi. Hence, the optimal solution of this algorithm is a feasible solution with maximum profit.
